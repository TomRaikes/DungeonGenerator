# DungeonGenerator
Very simple 2D dungeon generator for Dungeons n Dragons, will eventually have the following features:
- Random generation of mobs/enemies/chests/loot
- Ability to define what loot should be in the dungeon to help the DM out ;)
- Save state of game to pick up again at a later point
- Graphics! Sounds?!

Yeah I know using vue is probably a bit overkill for this right now but think of the extensibility down the line!

## How to run
Download the code and put it in a folder on your computer. Open terminal at that location and run `npm i && npm run dev`. Then navigate to the location that it is running at on a web browser - it'll give you the details when you run the previous command.
